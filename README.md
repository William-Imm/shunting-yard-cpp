# Shunting Yard Parsing (C++)

This program takes an equation in infix notation (eg: "(5 + 3) / 2 + 3 ^ 2") and converts it into a Reverse Polish Notation equation before parsing it.

While this was made as a programming exercise, it's one that I feel is worth sharing to the world

## Compiling

Simply run `make` to compile, and `make clean` to clean up.

## Todo
